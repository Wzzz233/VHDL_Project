# Baseline Metrics

## Scope
- Date:
- Branch / Commit:
- Bitstream:
- Driver version:
- Models:

## Unified Measurement Rules
- FPS definition:
- Latency definition (P50/P95/P99):
- Accuracy definition (detection/OCR/type):
- Stability definition (timeout, drop, crash):

## Baseline Results
| Metric | Value | Method | Raw Log Path |
|---|---:|---|---|
| FPS | TBD | | |
| Latency P50 (ms) | TBD | | |
| Latency P95 (ms) | TBD | | |
| Latency P99 (ms) | TBD | | |
| Detection F1 | TBD | | |
| OCR text acc | TBD | | |
| Plate type acc | TBD | | |
| 1h stability | TBD | | |
